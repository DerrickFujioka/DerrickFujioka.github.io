                <p id="Heading">Funny Story</p>
                <p id="BigText">When I first heard about the Volleyball team on the school bulletin, I was only
                    partially thinking about joining. Since previously I was in so much things being JROTC, Marching
                    Band, Crochet Club, Speech and Debate, and Robotics. So i really have my hands full. However, as
                    things started ending, I started wanting to keep me busy and something fun. So what I did was
                    procrastinated and didn't even go to the informational meeting. So I only heard the practice date
                    and location (since we don't have a gym anymore üòä) from my friends. I actually missed the first day
                    of the try-out since I had some other kind of practice I needed to attend to. So I was already off
                    to a bad start. So whne I went on the 2nd day of the try out I just told myself that if I
                    don't get in that it'll just be as sign from the heavens that I should take a nice break from so
                    many activities. But miraculously I didn't get kicked out just yet (But sadly my friend go let go
                    üòî). I thought that the people picking out the players forgot that I was even there. So the next day
                    I tried my hardest and again they didn't talk to me. But it wasn't confirmed until the following
                    week were I got jersey and I choose #6. Ever since I ‚ù§Ô∏è the sport. The team later won the IOA
                    championship game with the photo as proof.</p>
