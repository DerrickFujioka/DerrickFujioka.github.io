                <p id="Description">I'm a Pepsi over Coke drinker anyday. With my favorite obiously being cherry which I
                    was able to try at the Made in Hawaii Festival. What I thought was intresitng that it states that
                    it's made in Hawaii which is an intresting place to make. Since all the materials being needed for
                    it would be a lot higher with importation. Also if you want to know my least favorite is pepsi zero
                    because it doesn't have the same feel to it. I also have always wanted to try the peeps pepsi and if
                    you know please tell me 😊.</p>

                    coding teacher at Kaiser that I look like him. He told me that I had the same smile, which I
                    thought was funny since I thought that it looked like a dumb smile. Leading to me thinking that I
                    probably have dumb smile. But thankfully I don't have braces or else it'll trully make me look like
                    a loser 😊. Here is the picture his name is Garret.</p>
